                <h1>Our Chapter</h1>
                <p>Both State High TSA chapter 9/10 and 11/12 are part of PATSA Region 8 and have participated in TSA for many years. We are located in State College, Pennsylvania and attend State College Area High School, a historically high-performing school with a 93% high school graduation rate. Our school routinely achieves impressive performances in TSA, sending students to States and then Nationals every year. We encourage students to engage in community service projects and operate with a "Education First" attitude. One way we do this is by advertising certain community service projects such as a 5k to help fight cancer.</p>
                <h2>Both State High chapters strive to follow the TSA motto of "Learning to Lead In A Technological World."</h2>
                <p>We accomplish this by working as a team at weekly practices to develop the best understanding of various aspects of STEM. In addition, we elect a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Reporter, and Sergeant-at-Arms to develop and practice leadership skills.</p>
