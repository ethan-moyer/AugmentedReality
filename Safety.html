            <h2>Safety Benefits</h2>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2>Google Glass</h2>
                <p>Shafi Ahmed says he has used Google Glass to perform live operations for roughly 14,000 people.</p>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>Augmented reality lets you zoom in on objects and also research techniques at the same time.</p>
                <h2>VA-ST</h2>
                <p>In the future, VA-ST designers believes that their device can improve the vision of people who are partially blind.</p>
                <h4>Why?</h4>
                <p>Stephen Hicks says, "The majority of people who are legally blind have some remaining vision." Augmented reality can outline different objects in order to make them stand out.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <h2>Vipaar</h2>
              <p>Devices such as Vipaar allow for experts to accurately instruct other people on how to do surgery.</p>
              <h4>Why?</h4>
              <p>With augmented reality, experts can project their motions so another person can see the exact movements necessary to perform surgery.</p>
              <h2>AccuVein</h2>
              <p>Research done by AccuVein shows using the product leads to 350% better chance of successfully finding a vein while taking blood which results in 39% pain reduction and 45% fewer escalations during the procedure.</p>
              <h4>Why?</h4>
              <p>Augmented reality can scan someone's body and find where veins are located and highlight them for the operator to see.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2>Interfering with vision</h2>
                <h4>On the Road</h4>
                <p><b>Visual</b></p>
                <p>Eric E. Sabelman and Roger Lam find that adjusting between looking at glasses and looking at the road makes many people lose focus for a brief period of time.
                They also find that augmented reality devices will always obscure part of your vision, either peripheral or central. Either way, it could be enough to cause a blind spot in a person's vision.</p>
                <p><b>Distractions</b></p>
                <p>Augmented reality can also distract people's focus from whatever task they are trying to accomplish, just like phones or any other technology.</p>
        </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>Hacking</h2>
          <p>As with any piece of technology, augmented reality devices can be hacked. This has multiple issues:</p>
          <p><b>Privacy</b></p>
          <p>The government could potentially hack our devices to find out information.</p>
          <p>James Clapper, Director of National Security said, "In the future, intelligence services might use the [internet of things] for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials."</P>
          <p><b>Security</b></p>
          <p>Any augmented reality device requires an input of information. However, if hacked, that information would be available to the hacker. For example, if someone were to see secure information while wearing glasses, a hacker could see all of that information as well.</p>
          <p><b>Mass Attacks</b></p>
          <p>Possibly the most worrisome issue with augmented reality is the ability for someone to project information into what you see. The potential for attacks using augmented reality is seemingly limitless.</p>
          <p><b>On The Road</b></p>
          <p>An attack on a driver could be carried out by feeding an inaccurate projection of the positioning of cars on the road, leading to the driver's altered reality straying from the actual reality.</p>
          <p><b>Military</b></p>
          <p>If the military used augmented reality, an enemy could potentially feed them false data, resulting in any number of adverse effects.</p>
          <p><b>Medical</b></p>
          <p>Many medical devices using augmented reality require someone to see exactly what is going on. Any hack or alteration could cause someone to see the wrong thing and botching an operation.</p>
